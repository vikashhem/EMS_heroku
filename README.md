- Created a backend for Team Management Software which is a flutter based application for tracking , assigning projects/tasks to the employees of an organisation.
- There are two type of logins - admin/ user.
    Admin:
          1. The admin can register users after registering with an activation token and can                    create projects, add users, assign tasks and check the progress.
          2. Admin can set up deadlines, priority of tasks/ projects to be completed.
    User:
          1. The user can login after getting the login id from the admin/employer.
          2. Here the user can see the assigned tasks and projects along with priority and share               the progress of the tasks.
- The application also allows the users under a particular organization to chat within each other.
